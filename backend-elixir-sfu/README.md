# Elixir SFU with STUNner Gateway for Polycloud

This directory will contain the Elixir-based Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU) server implementation with STUNner Gateway for the Polycloud video conferencing application. This implementation demonstrates a scalable architecture for WebRTC applications.

## Planned Features

- Elixir-based SFU server for scalable media routing
- STUNner Gateway for WebRTC traffic management
- Distributed architecture for high availability
- Phoenix channels for signaling
- Real-time user presence and status updates
- Room-based participant grouping

## Implementation Status

ðŸš§ **Coming Soon** ðŸš§

This implementation is currently under development. Check back later for updates.

## Prerequisites (Planned)

- Elixir and Erlang OTP
- Mix build tool
- Docker (for STUNner Gateway)

## Getting Started (Planned)

Instructions for building and running the Elixir SFU server with STUNner Gateway will be provided once the implementation is available.

## How It Will Work

1. The Elixir application will handle signaling and user management
2. The STUNner Gateway will manage WebRTC traffic and NAT traversal
3. The SFU component will handle media routing between participants
4. This architecture leverages Elixir's concurrency model for handling many simultaneous connections
