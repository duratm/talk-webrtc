# Rust SFU Server for Polycloud

This directory will contain the Rust-based Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU) server implementation for the Polycloud video conferencing application. It will provide a more efficient approach to media routing compared to the WebSocket implementation.

## Planned Features

- Rust-based SFU server for efficient media routing
- Integrated TURN capabilities
- WebRTC peer connection management
- Room-based participant grouping
- Bandwidth adaptation

## Implementation Status

ðŸš§ **Coming Soon** ðŸš§

This implementation is currently under development. Check back later for updates.

## Prerequisites (Planned)

- Rust toolchain
- Cargo package manager

## Getting Started (Planned)

Instructions for building and running the Rust SFU server will be provided once the implementation is available.

## How It Will Work

1. The Rust SFU server will establish WebRTC connections with clients
2. Clients will send their media streams to the SFU server
3. The SFU server will selectively forward media streams to other clients based on bandwidth and preferences
4. This approach reduces the processing load on clients compared to mesh networking
